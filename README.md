VSTabBar
========

A custom Tab Bar write from scratch

VSTabBar is fully customizable:

* 	All colors could be changed (Background, Foreground, gradient selection, current selection item, etc.),
* 	Showing/Unshowing current selection,
* 	Showing/Unshowing selection indicator gradient,
* 	Showing/Unshowing title or/and image,
* 	Showing/Unshowing separator between items

In the most of case, you want to use a tabbar in bottom, but with VSTabBar you could set-up to be a topbar easily.
